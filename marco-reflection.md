# GPS 1.1 Reflections

## By Juan Marco

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concepts of creating branches so that we can introduce changes safely into the master branch by creating pull requests and merging them in.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
The difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`. I also asked specific clarifying questions when navigating and driving to make sure that we're all on the same page.


* What still confuses you about Git?
Do we still push everthing GitHub? For example, if we create a "feature branch", test the newly added features and then verify that they work. Then I can just merge the changes locally without pushing them to GitHub. But I guess that this makes more sense when other people collaborate on the same project. Still, I trust that this will become more evident and clear as I collaborate and work more with others on projects.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was awesome! I felt comfortable and was able to relax. The introductory chat was very helpful and it helped set the right tone for the entire GPS session.
