# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
# ANS: I felt pretty good about Git flow leading up to this GPS.  The session just gave additional practice and made the concepts learned last week more concrete. 
# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
# ANS: I didn't necessarily have any questions going in, but some things came up as we went (like the difference between fetch/merge vs. pull).  I also figured out how to get my multi-cursor to work in Sublime.
# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
# ANS: I occasionally asked my pair to confirm what I was doing (when I was driving) and about new concepts that came up (like fetch and displaying an image inline).
# What still confuses you about Git?
# ANS: I honestly do feel good about Git work flow.  It's just a matter of practicing and implementing these principles on larger scale projects. 
# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
# ANS: I really enjoyed my first GPS even though I was nervous going in.  But I thought Juan and I worked well together and consistently checked in as we moved through the material.  Helin was also a great guide.
